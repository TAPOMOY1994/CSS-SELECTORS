    <h1>Cheetah</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>A <span class="ok">cheetah</span> (Acinonyx jubatus) is a medium large cat which lives in Africa. It is the fastest land animal and can run up to 112 kilometers per hour for a short time. Most cheetahs live in the savannas of Africa. There are a few in Asia. Cheetahs are active during the day, and hunt in the early morning or late evening.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>The <span class="ok">cheetah</span> compared to other big cats is light and slimly built. Its long thin legs and long spotted tail are necessary for fast running.[2] Its lightly built, thin form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of other big cats. The head-and-body length ranges from 112–150 centimetres (44–59 in).[2] The cheetah stands 70 to 90 cm at the shoulder, and weighs 21–72 kilograms (46–159 lb).[2][3]

        The slightly curved claws are only weakly retractable (semi-retractable).[2] This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the other big cats, which have fully retractable claws.</p>
